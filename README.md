# XML-Address-Book
XML markup for address book (Retired)
This has three files: a DTD file defining XML fields for a home address book, an XML page containing these fields, and a CSS file for basic layout for rendering the XML file as a Web page. One of these days, I might write a Web-based address book using these.
